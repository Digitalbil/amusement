# How to Contribute
I can't say enough how much I welcome contributions. I'm open to literally anything - documentation, fixing bugs, adding parks.

## Getting Started
* Fork the repo on Github
* Make your changes on a separate branch
* Submit a Pull Request

Don't know how to do any of these things? Just ask me.

## Tests
I'm a stickler for tests. If you're fixing a bug that's not inherently obvious, please submit a test. For parks, an integration test will work just fine. The integration test should just prove that the park will assemble correctly and then has some rides or shows.

## Documentation
Documentation is always great (even for this page, which could use some serious work). Even if you have no code experience, feel free to make changes!
