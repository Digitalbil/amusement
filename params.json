{"name":"Amusement","tagline":"Python library for getting wait times from popular theme parks","body":"# amusement\r\n\r\namusement is a Python package to get the current wait times and show times of attractions at many popular theme parks. We currently support:\r\n\r\n* All Disney parks in USA, plus Paris\r\n* All Universal parks worldwide (with the exception of Singapore)\r\n* All Seaworld parks\r\n* Hersheypark\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n```\r\nfrom amusement.parks.universal.IslandsOfAdventure import IslandsOfAdventure\r\n\r\nioa = IslandsOfAdventure()\r\nprint ioa.rides()\r\nprint ioa.shows()\r\n```\r\nA full list of the rides and shows in the park will be displayed!\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n```\r\npip install amusement\r\n```\r\nThat's it!\r\n\r\n## Parks\r\namusement supports a lot of parks. Here's a breakdown of which parks are supported and which features have been implemented.\r\n\r\n| Park Name                     | Rides       | Shows       |\r\n| ------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\r\n| Magic Kingdom                 |x            |             |\r\n| Epcot                         |x            |             |\r\n| Hollywood Studios             |x            |             |\r\n| Animal Kingdom                |x            |             |\r\n| Disneyland                    |x            |             |\r\n| Disney's California Adventure |x            |             |\r\n| Universal Studios Florida     |x<sup>1</sup>|x<sup>1</sup>|\r\n| Islands of Adventure          |x<sup>1</sup>|x<sup>1</sup>|\r\n| Universal Studios Hollywood   |x<sup>2</sup>|x<sup>2</sup>|\r\n| Universal Studios Japan       |x<sup>3</sup>|x<sup>3</sup>|\r\n| Hersheypark                   |x            |             |\r\n| Seaworld Orlando              |x            |x            |\r\n| Seaworld San Diego            |x            |x            |\r\n| Seaworld San Antonio          |x            |x            |\r\n| Busch Gardens Williamsburg    |x            |x            |\r\n| Busch Gardens Tampa           |x            |x            |\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> USF/IOA currently only show a subset of attractions in the park. We are looking to address this in a future release.\r\n\r\n<sup>2</sup> USH uses the official times based off of the USH website. Because this is a website that does not consistently present times in a predictable format, this may fail from time to time.\r\n\r\n<sup>3</sup> If the park is closed, nothing will appear. We hope to address this in a future release.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\nI welcome any and all contributions!
